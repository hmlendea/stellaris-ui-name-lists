# About

Mod that adds [dozens of new and detailed name lists](https://github.com/hmlendea/stellaris-ui-name-lists/wiki/Name-Lists) to Stellaris.

The highlight is the "Human - Extended" list that contains thousands upon thousands of names from various languages, both from history and from fiction (especially space operas).
There are also individual name lists for each of the used human language, or groups.

Other name lists include ones taken from species from other games or movies such as `Galactic Civilizations`, `StarCraft`, `No Man's Sky`, `The Elder Scrolls`, `Star Wars`, and others
